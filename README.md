Welcome to my GitHub! 
As you might have already noticed, I am not the next Bill Gates or Steve Jobs but I do share their ambitions.

in my repositories you will find my current adventure to navigate the core curriculum of the 42 school. I am doing my mega best.
I love working with people and I love sharing my knowledge and also receiving it from my fellow peers.
i love being at 42 it truly made me rekindle my love for education after spending way too long at a university that asks me to write a programming exam on paper. (no no not Algorithms, data structures or even Complexity analysis, just plain old C on paper)

42 allows me to unapologetically be my authentic chaotic self and let's me embrace it because through failure i learn success, and through my peers i learn perseverance. 
So I hope you enjoyed this introduction, and if you have any questions please DO come to me. if you have critiques or ways to improve my code PLEASE do come to me, I would be extremely grateful. 
with love, Norruna ❤️
